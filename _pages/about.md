I am Moeka Ono, an Ecology PhD student at the Department of Ecology and Conservation Biology at Texas A&M University. My research has focused on carbon cycling and allocation, soil carbon dynamics, and soil respiration in forest ecosystems. I aim to pursue a career as a professional researcher in carbon cycling within natural ecosystems, working to enhance carbon sequestration through nature-based solutions and contribute to mitigating climate change.  

My Backgrounds
======
I received a BS in Agriculture from Hokkaido University in Japan, during which I spent two semesters as an exchange student in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Beyond my academic journey, I earned a Data Science Bootcamp certificate from the Erdos Institute to enhance my data analysis skills and apply them to my research in forest ecology.
